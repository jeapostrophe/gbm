gbm - Get Bonus Machine

A fantasy console.

DONE:
- Experiment with extremely minimal OpenGL window setup

- Experiment with extremely minimal code execution

TODO:

- Experiment with GNU lightning
  https://www.gnu.org/software/lightning/manual/lightning.html

- Experiment with minimal sound
- Experiment with minimal threading to connect them together
- Expand language & port sound & graphics code

IDEAS:
- interim has a simple JIT that is neat
https://github.com/mntmn/interim/blob/master/sledge/jit_x64.c

- I could make the programs like an old ROM where we have a header
  that describes stuff like, how much RAM, SRAM, etc there is. It
  could also say how many display sprites can be used at once and
  stuff like that. This would facilitate stuff like auto-reloading of
  code and objects, plus simplifying perform because we could be
  guaranteed there are no system calls or anything.

- It would be cool to integrate this project with manual-compiler and
  directly build the binary blobs from assembly.
